## What is this?

This is an example Slidify presentation created for Coursera's Data Products course in October 2014.

For this project, I created a simple Shiny application. The presentation and code are hosted online at the links below.

## The App

The app ([hosted here](https://kasimte.shinyapps.io/shiny-app/)) uses the USArrests dataset included in R and uses three simple linear models to predict arrest rates based on urban population percentage.

You can change the urban population percentage using a slider and see the rates change (see screenshot below).

## The code

The code can be seen completely on Github [here](https://github.com/kasimte/coursera-data-products-project). We can show partially what the app is doing by running some R code right here.


```{r}
library(shiny)
library(datasets)
percent <- 72
murderModel <- lm(Murder ~ UrbanPop, data=USArrests)
predict(murderModel,data.frame(UrbanPop = c(72)))
```
